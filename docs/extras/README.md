# Extras

This part of the documentation is a little unique, and it's more personal in nature. It doesn't contain anything that will help you use the `Form Observer` tools. Instead, it's a section that will help you understand _why_ certain decisions were made for the tool and _who_ had an impact on how this tool was created.

Two parts of the documentation -- the [Development Notes](./development-notes.md), and the [Design Decisions](./DESIGN_DECISIONS.md) -- will give you unique insights into some of the larger problems/questions that I faced and how I chose to address them. This section is helpful for me because it will help the _future_ me understand _why_ I made certain design decisions. But perhaps there are some of you who are helped in your own career by seeing other developers think through their own challenges. In case that's true, I've made these notes a public part of the documentation. I hope you find it helpful -- or at least interesting. :&rpar;

Another part of the documentation -- the [Special Thanks](./SPECIAL_THANKS.md) -- is a _non-exhaustive_ list of those who I believe played an important part in the `Form Observer`'s successful creation and completion. I believe it is important to give honor where it is due, so I wanted to dedicate a portion of the documentation strictly to that.

Although these notes aren't necessary for helping you use the `Form Observer` effectively, I still hope you find them insightful and profitable.
