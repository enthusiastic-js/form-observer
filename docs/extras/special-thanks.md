# Special Thanks (INCOMPLETE)

We often get amazed by developers who come up with "the newest and greatest ideas". In those moments, we can be tempted to think, "Wow! They did all of that on their own!" And there is certainly some honor due to them for their bright ideas and hard work. However, what easily gets forgotten is that -- very likely -- there is no possible way that those developers would have accomplished what they did without the previous work of others. If I'm being honest, I can tend to forget this as well; so I'm holding this up as a reminder to myself and others of how we got here. Of course, I'm not asserting that the `Form Observer` is the greatest thing created. However, I am happy with what I've made, and I hope that others are as well.

Below are some of the people I wanted to acknowledge (listed in ascending order for the impact that they had). This list is _non-exhaustive_. I unfortunately cannot list _every single contributor_, as the list would be far too long. There are definitely indirect contributors who I don't know and/or who have already passed. But I've tried to point out the people who -- as far as I understand -- played an especially important role in this accomplishment.

Some extra draft stuff.

I want to "give honor where honor is due", as the Scriptures say. There are so many people that I could give thanks to at this point that I might forget some of them. So I want to make a dynamic list _now_ before I forget. Then, in the future, I'll put this content in its appropriate place in the docs. This list is _non-exhaustive_. And this list is not necessarily finalized, though it's highly unlikely that any person or group present will be removed. If anything, the order of appreciation would just get shifted around. However, Jesus will always get the highest appreciation -- undeniably.

Appreciation should be in assending order

- All package managers of any dev dependencies in this project (makes development easier)
  - TypeScript specifically
  - Testing Library specifically
- jcalz [(StackOverflow)](https://stackoverflow.com/users/2887218/jcalz), [(GitHub)](https://github.com/jcalz) for his random TypeScript help visible on the internet
- [marioalexsan](https://github.com/Marioalexsan) for helping me with run design decision ideas by him.
- [Chris Ferdinandi](https://gomakethings.com/about/) --> Understanding event delegation, which led to this idea
- Kent C. Dodds (testing knowledge, Testing Library pioneer, react knowledge, etc.)
- The guy who taught us event delegation
- React Hook Form was an inspiration
- MojoTech's MojoTime
- The Lord Jesus Christ

What is a man on his own? I will give thanks to God, and I will honor those who have helped me accomplish this feat.
