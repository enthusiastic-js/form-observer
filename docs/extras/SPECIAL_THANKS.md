# Special Thanks

I want to "give honor where honor is due", as the Scriptures say. There are so many people that I could give thanks to at this point that I might forget some of them. So I want to make a dynamic list _now_ before I forget. Then, in the future, I'll put this content in its appropriate place in the docs. This list is _non-exhaustive_. And this list is not necessarily finalized, though it's highly unlikely that any person or group present will be removed. If anything, the order of appreciation would just get shifted around. However, Jesus will always get the highest appreciation -- undeniably.

Appreciation should be in assending order

- All package managers of any dev dependencies in this project (makes development easier)
  - TypeScript specifically
  - Testing Library specifically
- jcalz [(StackOverflow)](https://stackoverflow.com/users/2887218/jcalz), [(GitHub)](https://github.com/jcalz) for his random TypeScript help visible on the internet
- [marioalexsan](https://github.com/Marioalexsan) for helping me with run design decision ideas by him.
- [Chris Ferdinandi](https://gomakethings.com/about/) --> Understanding event delegation, which led to this idea
- Kent C. Dodds (testing knowledge, Testing Library pioneer, react knowledge, etc.)
- The guy who taught us event delegation
- React Hook Form was an inspiration
- MojoTech's MojoTime
- The Lord Jesus Christ

What is a man on his own? I will give thanks to God, and I will honor those who have helped me accomplish this feat.
